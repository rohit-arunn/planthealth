# planthealth
 It is an automated irrigation and plant health monitoring system which uses Arduino to collect images and ML to classify plant conditions, it has an email alert system for the health status of the plant, and a web page which displays the real-time soil moisture levels. 

 For carrying out this project one would inevitably have to satify both the hardware and software requirements. The hardware side includes Arduino microcontroller, USB A2B, FC-28 Soil moisture sensor, DHT11 sensor, 9g Micro Servo motor, 0.96" OLED display, and jumper wires. The software side includes Python 3.11, HTML, JavaScript.
